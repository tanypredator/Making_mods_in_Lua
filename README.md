# trying-to-make-mods-in-Lua
Here I upload my work process and results in making mods for Surviving Mars using the language Lua.

"Lakes No Vaporation" makes Lakes to lose water due to evaporation in a rate that depends on a global Terraforming Water level.
It looks more natural that evaporation decreases in more humid atmosphere. Lakes stop evaporation at 80% of Terr. Water level.
One may say that heating Mars will increase evaporation. But at the same time it would melt some underground water to feed Lakes :)
