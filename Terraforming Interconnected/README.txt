This mod aims to improve the Terraforming system introduced with Green Planet, and to make it more enjoyable and realistic. It is a collaborative, massive rework of the whole Terraforming system, and includes the following changes:
1) Terraforming parameters are now interconnected
Atmosphere increases Temperature if the difference is big enough.
Temperature increases Water if the difference is big enough.
Vegetation is increasing based on all parameters. Vegetation cannot be viable in a level higher that the lowest other parameter.
Vegetation increases Atmosphere.

2) Terraforming technologies are rearranged and their cost is now the same as for usual technologies.

3) Major building changes: Magnetic field Generator is replaced with Silva's Geothermal Power Plant and Core heat Convector is replaced with Deep aquifer extractor
Magnetic field Generator seemes to be a bit of nonsense at least in its current form of a little building. Silva kindly allowed us to include Geothermal Power Plant into our mod. It is slightly reworked to produce Temperature instead of Atmosphere and to be independent from Silva's Essentials.
Core heat Convector is changed to a building with the same model but producing water for colony and increasing the global Water instead of Temperature. It must be placed over the water source (to be changed).

4) Minor building changes
Carbonate Processor is now much cheaper, but its effect decreases as the Atmosphere grows. It is now supposed to be the starting terraforming building. Its waste rock consumption is increased.
Forestation Plant's global effect is now increasing with the improvement of the lowest environment parameter. It goes up to 100%.

6) Changes in Special Projects
Import Greenhouse Gasses is changed to Import Atmospheric Gases with changed cost; it gives 5% Atmosphere.
Launch Space Mirror is now instantly repeatable; it gives Temperature increase instead of single-time effect; the rocket isn't lost for this project now.
Launch Space Sunshade (Magnetic Shield) is now instantly repeatable; the rocket isn't lost for this project now.
Melt The Polar Caps Project now requires fundings (nuclear weapon is expensive); the rocket isn't lost for this project now.
Cloud Vegetation Project now requires more seeds (200).

7) All new effects are displayed on Terraforming infopanel.

The mod is made together with Bear and with great help from ChoGGi. Also thanks to Silva for the great Geothermal Power Plant and for permission to use it!
